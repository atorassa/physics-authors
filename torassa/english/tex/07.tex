\begin{abstract}
\noindent This work presents a new equation of motion for a particle in classical mechanics, which can be applied in any non-rotating reference frame (inertial or non-inertial) without the necessity of introducing fictitious forces.

{\centering\subsection*{Equation of Motion}}

\par The acceleration $\vA\ra$ of a particle A relative to a reference frame S (non-rotating) fixed to a particle S is given by the following equation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vA\ra = \frac{\sum \vF\ra}{\mm\ra} - \frac{\sum \vF\rs}{\mm\rs}
\end{eqnarray*}
\noindent where $\sum \vF\ra$ is the sum of the forces acting on particle A, $\mm\ra$ is the mass of particle A, $\sum \vF\rs$ is the sum of the forces acting on particle S, and $\mm\rs$ is the mass of particle S.

{\centering\subsection*{Observations}}

\par In contradiction with Newton's first and second laws, from the last equation above it follows that the acceleration of particle A relative to the reference frame S fixed to particle S depends not only on the forces acting on particle A, but also on the forces acting on particle S. That is, particle A can have an acceleration relative to the reference frame S even if there is no force acting on particle A, and also particle A can have an acceleration of zero (state of rest or of uniform linear motion) relative to the reference frame S even if there is an unbalanced force acting on particle A.

\vspace{+0.27em}

\par Finally, from the last equation above it follows that Newton's first and second laws are valid in the reference frame S only if the sum of the forces acting on particle S is equal to zero. Therefore, the reference frame S is an inertial reference frame if the sum of the forces acting on particle S is equal to zero, but it is a non-inertial reference frame if the sum of the forces acting on particle S is not equal to zero.

{\centering\subsection*{Dynamical Behavior of Particles}}

\par The behavior of two particles A and B which follow Newton's second law is determined from a reference frame S (inertial) by the equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum \vF\ra = \mm\ra\vA\ra \\
\sum \vF\rb = \mm\rb\vA\rb
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent that is
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\sum \vF\ra}{\mm\ra} - \vA\ra = 0 \\
\frac{\sum \vF\rb}{\mm\rb} - \vA\rb = 0
\end{eqnarray}
\par Combining the equations (3) and (4) yields
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\sum \vF\ra}{\mm\ra} - \vA\ra = \frac{\sum \vF\rb}{\mm\rb} - \vA\rb
\end{eqnarray}
\par Therefore, the behavior of particles A and B is now determined from the reference frame S by the equation (5).
\par Now, if the equation (5) is transformed from the reference frame S to another non-rotating reference frame S' (inertial or non-inertial) using the transformations of kinematics and \hbox {dynamics:} ($\vA\rt = \vA - \vA\rot$), ($\vF\rt = \vF$) and ($\mm\rt = \mm$), it follows that
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\sum {\vF\ra}\rt}{{\mm\ra}\rt} - {\vA\ra}\rt = \frac{\sum {\vF\rb}\rt}{{\mm\rb}\rt} - {\vA\rb}\rt
\end{eqnarray}
\par Considering that the equation (6) have the same form as the equation (5), then it can be assumed that the behavior of particles A and B is determined from any non-rotating reference frame (inertial or non-inertial) by the equation (5).
\par Now, if the equation (5) is applied to a particle A and a non-rotating reference frame S (inertial or non-inertial) fixed to a particle S, then
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\sum \vF\ra}{\mm\ra} - \vA\ra = \frac{\sum \vF\rs}{\mm\rs} - \vA\rs
\end{eqnarray}
\par Since the acceleration $\vA\rs$ of particle S relative to the non-rotating reference frame S equals zero always, $\vA\ra$ may be obtained from the equation (7) as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\vA\ra = \frac{\sum \vF\ra}{\mm\ra} - \frac{\sum \vF\rs}{\mm\rs}
\end{eqnarray}
\par Finally we obtain the equation (8) which represents the new equation of motion for a particle in classical mechanics, which can be applied in any non-rotating reference frame (inertial or non-inertial) without the necessity of introducing fictitious forces.
